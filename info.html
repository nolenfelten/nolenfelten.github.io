  <p><b><center><u>Original Work</u></center></b></p>
  <p>-Designed and built an application for the retro Original Xbox game console!</p>
  <p>This was interesting for a few reasons. Orignal Xbox carries only ~64MB of RAM to work with and due to the system security: Only one process runs at a time!</p>
  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_modding">Thanks to genuis Reverse Engineers</a>, it is possible to exploit the console to run homebrew code without paying for a Developer License.</p>
  <p>It was not long until people began replacing Microsoft's very restricted OS with Linux.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBMC4Xbox">XBMC4Xbox</a> project (which later forked into the modern media center application, known as "Kodi") was a homebrew replacement OS for hacked Xbox's.</p>
  <p>XBMC4Xbox has a Python 2.7 interpretor built into it with GUI capabilities. The fun part behind the project is XBMC4Xbox already occupies 41/64MB of RAM.</p>
  <p>By taking advantage of the Python engine, I was able to create a full application that allows the user to browse a list of Original Xbox game titles, select the title they wish to download (provided the file has a host), then extract and install the game right to consoles hard drive.</p>
  <p>Why isn't there more game installers on hacked consoles? Why be forced to manuelly download each game, extract the archive, extract the xIso disc image, then FTP that over the network to the console hard drive.</p>

          <p>I met someone that was looking to exchange some Bitcoin. Since, I have contracted my professional time working one on one with the client building applications.</p>
          <p>Most projects are classified. I assure they are not Black Hat.</p>
          <p><u>Examples of work:</u></p>
          <p><b><a href='#'>Text-If-Change.py</a></b> - A tool used to fetch a webpage periodically, and if there is any difference in the page, it will set off a loop that will send a text message every 5 seconds.</p>
          <p>Proud of my Client <=> Developer interaction. I just so happened to have written a <a href="https://github.com/nolenfelten/SMS-Bomb/blob/master/SMS%20Bomber.py">script</a> that spams a phone number with text messages using SMTP protocol. So I quickly hacked it as a template, and was able to build the whole gizmo as fast as the client was describing it over facebook.</p>
