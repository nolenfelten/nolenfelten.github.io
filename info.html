        <p>I met someone that was looking to exchange some Bitcoin. Since, I have contracted my professional time working one on one with projects.</p>
        <p>Most projects are classified. I assure they are not Black Hat.</p>
        <p><u>Examples of work:</u></p>
        <p><b><a href='#'>Text-If-Change.py</a></b> - A tool used to fetch a webpage periodically, and if there is any difference in the page, it will set off a loop that will send a text message every 5 seconds.</p>
        <p>Proud of my Client <=> Developer interaction. I just so happened to have written a <a href="https://github.com/nolenfelten/SMS-Bomb/blob/master/SMS%20Bomber.py">script</a> that spams a phone number with text messages using SMTP protocol. So I quickly hacked it as a template, and was able to build the whole gizmo as fast as the client was describing it over facebook.</p>
