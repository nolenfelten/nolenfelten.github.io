        <p>Hey I read your post about psionic practice. I fully agree most people either gave it a single shot and gave up after one failure or never even tried. I have been attempting to learn / practice but there is a lot of conflicting info out there. Would you be willing to walk me through your process? (Obviously I wouldn't expect your style to work on the first or even 50th time but I do think having some formal instructions would be beneficial)</p>
        <p>If not no worries as this kind of development is personal and I wouldn't want to pry</p>

        <p>Sure.</p>
        <p>To summarize my post i would say that i was just lucky to have had certain information exposed to me in the right order. </p>
        <p>To start, get a average sized post-it note, and a thumb tack (the kind with the colored plastic part on it...you know...a thumb tack). </p>
        <p>Fold the post-it note like this tutorial and stand the thumb tack needle side up like this link:</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Psi-Wheel" target="_blank">https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Psi-Wheel</a></p>
        <p>Once setup, forget everything you read online about it because most of it will just fuck you up. Put your finger right up to it and observe how you don't have to touch it in order to feel it.</p>

        <p>No dumb questions here. No you do not need to build up energy. Just focus on the fact you can feel things that your finger is almost touching. No aura, no energy.</p>
        <p>Just be real here. Don't be concerned with how or why.</p>

        <p>Alright good now your next instruction is I want you to put your finger near it like you are allllmossttttt touching, like you been.</p>
        <p>You can feel the air in the room gently on it. Almost like you feel the air move between the wheel and the tip of your finger.</p>

        <p>We're moving kind of fast here so imma give you a day or two to take your time with this. I know I know its hard for me to hold back but there is a structure going on here....that I'm totally making up as we go along but with experience.</p> 
        <p>But one concept I want you to understand is analytical overlay. This is what slowed down my progress because I was always trying to find the next mind blowing game tip or epiphany.</p> 
        <p>This led me to try out different beliefs and techniques. And maybe I got a spike in results (which is down the road from your current position in this course).</p>
        <p>Things like oh yeah build up psi using visualization, do you draw energy from the earth from under your feet and up your legs, etc.</p> 
        <p>Or do I draw energy from up above to the top of my head down my neck, down my shoulders, down my arms?</p>
        <p>What the fuck is a Chakra? If I didn't read about it and saw a graphic with different places in my body where they are located...would I have naturally realized they were there?</p> 
        <p>Well I already read about it and saw the graphic, so now I'm fucked.</p> 
        <p>That last part ^^^</p> 
        <p>Just stick with me here.</p> 
        <p>Thank you.</p>

        <p>Chew on this one...how the hell do you feel...well any body part really...but let's say your finger. Where does that start and end? Don't actually answer that lol but I can extend this concept further then I would like to when I said I have to hold back and don't want to:</p>
        <p>How the hell...do you move your finger?</p>
        <p>Not with words or logic. I mean you. YOU! Yeah, YOU! Where does your sense of feeling to your finger end? I never claimed to know this myself but I dawned on me when I was able to be one with the psi wheel, I can feel what it feels.</p>
        <p>You are being an excellent student. Thank you, I am having a blast sharing this with you.</p>

        <p>No worries it's late and I'm terrible at spelling on a good day so I totally understand hahaha</p>
        <p>The feeling what it feels is interesting it's almost like an empathic connection with the object</p>
        <p>Also the not thinking just doing naturally is very interesting because that's how all of my successful attempts have been. Almost accidents where I just kind of knew</p>

        <p>Keep using the same psi wheel as you go along.</p>
        <p>i mean try different ones and adopt new "usual" psi wheels because some were just easier</p>
        <p>There will be a time when rotating it wont be difficult, in fact, controlling when it stops will be the next area of skill to level up in, then stopping and changing direction.</p>
        <p>Draw numbers where I did in this shitty mspaint.exe photo. You can write on a paper that it will rotate left/right two times and stop on whatever number before you do it. Calling which number will be facing you before hand.</p>
        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/J5vtU7k.png" alt="Numbered Psi Wheel">
        <p>You see all the theories and stuff give you an sense of understanding that it works. Its not what you believe, its that you believe it works. This is why you only gain temporary boost in your results.</p>
        <p>Todays paradigm shifting epiphany becomes tomorrows gimmicky crutch.</p>

        <p>It is not even that you believe it works!!!</p>
        <p>You see, Sigmund Freud detailed the existence of the unconscious mind in several of his works.</p>
        <p>Modern psychology acknowledges that much of our mental processing occurs outside of conscious awareness.</p>
        <p>Like implicit memory, automatic processing of tasks and decisions such as driving or typing.</p>
        <p>Advances in neuroscience have provided further evidence for unconscious processing. Brain imaging studies show that many cognitive processes occur without conscious awareness, supporting the idea that a significant portion of our mental activity is unconscious.</p>

        <p>Makes sense. Yeah my successful stuff has been directed heat generation and dice predictions (either I predicted them or influenced them unsure which). Both of those happened multiple times while tipsy - drunk in college. My guess was alcohol removed some inhibitors and I was just able to do without thinking (obviously a terrible and unhealthy crutch so I'm working on learning to consistent clear headed sober).</p>
        <p>It actually happened so much that a few of my friends had a running joke that I was a sorcerer because I would just make things happen without explanation</p>
        <p>I had one friend call someone out when it was a cloudy day and we wanted to head to the beach and I was like "no worries it will clear" and one of the guys we were with quoted the weather report and my friend was like "idk dude if he says it will happen it will. Shits wild"</p>
        <p>But for now working on feeling the air between my finger and the wheel</p>
        <p>Learning the correct way is slow but better to build good habits when forming the foundation</p>

        <p>i was so set on going after the million dollar james randi prize that it really really is a shame that i smoked pot</p>
        <p>the first requirement was some kind of media, a newspaper...who the hell reads a newspaper even back in 2008. I went to my high schools student body meeting and went through all the stupid hoops to have a psionics club created because of all people, my algebra teacher saw me practicing a psi ball and knew what i was doing!!!</p>

        <p>so i had a teacher agree to host, that was that requirement, i had 3 students, 2 were bros one was a my girlfriend. We met up, she taught us about theta healing which idk lol even back then. But it was written and thats what i needed.</p>
        <p>But really, the randi foundation is the one who chooses when somebody has become elidable. So you can play your cards right but to even enter level 1 they were playing gate keepers.</p>
        <p>You needed some media attention, then if i remember right a response from the randi educational foundation...see they are a gang making up rules and titles. You the alpha boss bowser at the top with his assistants running the show</p>
        <p>Then you need a doctors note saying your not crazy. Okay so another gate keeper!!!</p>
        <p>So really i gotta demonstrate to somebody who works for the press that has the power to put their reputation on the line IF THEIR EDITOR ALLOWS it.</p>

        <p>So its like, i need to find someone who knows someone in the press, demonstrate to them, then demonstrate to the reporter AND their editor, then hope i get initiated, get a doctors note which is another demonstration, I'm sure but assuming.</p>
        <p>THEN THEY WANT ME TO COME UP WITH $5,000 AND FLY TO THEM IN FLORIDA...I'm in highschool with a single working mother who struggled my entire teenage years to pay for cost of living in Sonoma County, a place famous for high cost of living.</p>
        <p>So I can demonstrate to his first staff member under whatever conditions, im sure they would actually be cool given i just wagered 5 grand.</p>
        <p>Then Mr.Randi's own assistants want to have a look, which now its costing peoples time = money to watch me me twirl a little paper on a tack, which is no problem. When you put a glass dome over the psi wheel, you can do it eventually, but the glass is something that that will take a moment to adjust to because you know it doesnt matter but its still there...youll see.</p>
        <p>I doubt there is any second chances going on there.</p>
        <p>Then I will finally meet mr randi after staying in what hotel this whole time on whos dollar every day???</p>
        <p>Now mr randi is someone that is a legend and I would flip if I saw him in person because its like the original david blaine. He's so cool!!!</p>
        <p>He's probably going to be a dick and everyone in the room will side with him and the girls will laugh at me because of his comments.</p>
        <p>FUCK THAT!</p>

        <p>And the fact he had this million dollar inner circle jerk prize for over 40 years unclaimed is literally what I seen TEXT BOOKS use as their evidence and licence to alienate any ideas on the contrary to the status quo.</p>

        <p>Oh when I said this is teaching has a structure to it, this is what I mean:</p>
        <p>Since you now understand through experience of sensation that you can feel the psi wheel when your finger is real real close, however not touching it.</p>
        <p>Let me pull back the curtain and show you something:</p>
        <p>Establish that empathetic connection, and I want you to pull back your hand while holding it down.</p>
        <p>holding it down = feeling the connections</p>
        <p>So there is 2 parts, one is using your hand near by and concentrating on that air air sensation to a region, and second is maintaining your focus with your hand near then move your hand away.</p>

        <p>Right now, where you are at, I want you to not be Mr.Scientist and if you believe/know a result is you, then do what works. Whatever it was that led up to that, if it worked, repeat it. Even if it was the breeze, fuck it, everybody always acts like there is somebody standing over their shoulder that they have to prove a result to.</p>
        <p>I'm sure you have a good head on your shoulders. I'm saying trick yourself but I am saying anything that is a result..is a result. Get the results.</p>

        <p>done starts with doctors moving your arm for you to get that blood flow to the muscles started.</p>
        <p>- Start getting results. Discussed the effect of theories further by explaining the conscious <-> subconscious communication is strengthened not because of the theories logic and details (even though is seems that way) but rather you assume it's real and are able to more clearly communicate to your subconscious, leading to increased results.</p>
        <p>- Practice changes from trying to get any result at all rotating the psi wheel, to controlling a specific direction it spins and stopping rotation.

        <p>Oh I remember, you were to start practice with your hand further away from the psi wheel to segway to the realization that having your hand close is a crutch ✏️ and that not having your hand close sort introduces difficulty getting results.</p>
        <p>Which is because you have formed a habit. How strong a habit is, is determined by the "weight" of the neurological pathway you have grown. The more you do anything with your body, the more your brain reuses the same path to send a signal. When you break a habit, it's difficult because the brain has to...."rewire itself" you might have heard someone sat.</p>

        <p>So you know that you don't have to have your hand close yet you experience difficulty with your hand out of the picture.</p>
        <p>I, myself, always found it to be easier with my hand up close, and never truly got to a point where I could say it the same without my hand, but I almost did.</p>
        <p>When you grow to having a glass put over the wheel to demonstrate that it's not air moving the psi wheel, it always trip me out but the feeling of accomplishment is so cool when it still works and it's under the glass. 100%</p>

        <p>I wonder what the formula there is.</p>

        <p>There is still a lot to unveil, but tell me where you are at.</p>
        <p>Checklist:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="timestamp">Jun 14</div>

    <div class="chat-container">
        <p>- Started with fine tuning awareness, aka introduce the idea that you can feel something by almost touching it.</p>
        <p>- We built on that to form "empathetic connection" more easily, quickly, and concentrated with practice.</p>
        <p>- We introduce the idea that theories on how Psychokinesis is possible are not required to practice. Just as moving your fingers doesn't require knowledge of the nervous system.</p>
        <p>We use the "connection" to experience the sensation of the psi wheel moving using light room air circulation. Just like physical therapy for recovering from a broken bone starts with doctors moving your arm for you to get that blood flow to the muscles started.</p>
        <p>- Start getting results. Discussed the effect of theories further by explaining the conscious <-> subconscious communication is strengthened not because of the theories logic and details (even though is seems that way) but rather you assume it's real and are able to more clearly communicate to your subconscious, leading to increased results.</p>
        <p>- Practice changes from trying to get any result at all rotating the psi wheel, to controlling a specific direction it spins and stopping rotation.
