			Academy/Bonuses/Importing From China Q & A

			<ul>
				<li><b>Q</b>: What is up with import tax, duties, and fees?</li>
				<li><b>A</b>:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>It depends on your country.</li>
					<li>"First fees" are duties/tariffs TCIF. </li>
					<li>Footwear and clothes have highest tariffs because China flooded the world with those products, tariffs on them can sometimes be 200%.</li>
					<li>USA has high tariffs on imports to protect its local industry.</li>
					<li>North America Free Trade Association (<b>NAFTA</b>).</li>
					<li>Work around examples for tariffs:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>USA has tariffs on candles, but not on just wax or just wicks.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>When you actually import the goods, you pay for the tariffs on their arrival.</li>
					<ul>
						<li><i><b>If you have good credit with your freight forwarder</b>, you might be able to delay paying for 90 days.</i> <br>This could be useful.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Because of an international agreement plan, tariffs were lowered in 2010, and <i>will be</i> again in 2020, and again in 2030.</li>
				</ul>

				<li><b>Q</b>: How do you avoid buying poor quality proucts?</li>
				<li><b>A</b>:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Do your duties on finding the right sources.</li>
					<li>Search multiple factories for different prices.</li>
					<li>Fly to china to meet with them.</li>
					<li>Globalsources, Alibaba, Madeinchina are good websites.</li>
					<li><b>Maybe</b> - Make a list of different prices and remove the lowest 20%.</li>
					<li>You get what you pay for.</li>
					<li>Send an inspection team to the factory and inspect legitimacy of company.</li>
					<li>When you establish local presence with factory, they wont mess with you.</li>
					<li>Contract with sources to create "purchase orders" that have phases.</li>
					<li>Set clauses in the contract that penalize the vendor everyday an order is late.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>This will make the source speak up if they need more time.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Pay the vendor at the different checkpoints in the deal, like $30 over 30 days.</li>
					<li>Setup 3 phases.</li>
					<li>"Dont shoot the hostage" == Dont pay all at once.</li>
				</ul>

				<li><b>Q</b>: How can you enter a market with established competition?</li>
				<li><b>A</b>:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Pick a niche.</li>
					<li>Dont be a jack of all trades.</li>
					<li>Pick a niche that is a <sup><b>1</b></sup>/<sub><b>4</b></sub><sup>th</sup> of an inch wide, but 8 miles deep.</li>
					<li><u><b>You want a niche because you can keep the clients information for repeat purchasing leads</u>.</b></li>
				</ul>
			</ul>

			Academy/Bonuses/Importing From China Q & A Part 2
			<ul>
				<li><b>Q</b>: How can you enter a market with established competition? (Continued)</li>
				<li><b>A</b>:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Brenden notes that the power is in the customers hands because of the cost to promote on source websites like Alibaba.</li>
					<li>Use Telegraphic Transfer for money transfer.</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Get the bank details from supplier like bank name, bank number, bank account, swift code for identifying foreign banks.</li>
						<li>Make sure there is a record for the swift code.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>When the transfer is sent, send supplier a photocopy of the tranfser receipt.</li>
					<li>When you show you can be trusted by the vendor, prices will likely go down.</li>
					<li>Warren Buffet has a net worth of $62,000,000,000, China exports $62,000,000,000 every week.</li>

				<li>Use 2 hands when giving and receiving business cards.</li>
				<li>If working with Chinese, have one side of the card in English and other side Chinese (Mandarin).</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Use gold ink.</li>
					<li>Be sure to have Chinese side facing up when handing over card.</li>

				<li>Steven Foster - Customs Broker (30 years experience) - Powerhouse Logistics (phl.net.au)</li>
				<li>Customs protect a country from the illegal transportation of products and people. They administer the series of acts that prevent such cargo from entering a country.</li>
				<li>Customs Agent/Broker/Officer are the same.</li>
				<li>Customs Brokers research the product to see what regulations may effect it, and try to find ways to reduce the tariffs on shipments. The goal of a customs broker is to do everything possible to make a shipment duty free.</li>
				<li>"The assumption is that it should be duty free"</li>
				<li>The difference between an expert and novice Customs Broker is details.</li>
				<li>In Australia, Customs could penalize up to 200% (months or years later) if proper duties are not correctly paid.</li>
				<li>Customs Broker/Agents are licensed by Customs and are REQUIRED to report anyone they suspect is doing something illegal.</li>
				<li>Sales Tax is paid on arrival of goods, or you can submit a Business Activity Statement monthly (which must be done electronically) if you do not have any other tax issues.</li>

			Using a Sourcing Agent with Lindy Chen and Brendan Elias
			
			<ul>
				<li>Soucring agents work differently.</li>
				<li>Depends on what sourcing agent defines	themselves through.</li>
				<li>The amount of work and expertise required to	source from China is often underestimated.</li>
				<li>If an agent can demonstrate ability to manage a project end-to-end, it will save time coordinating agents and inspection of companies, critical orders, customs.</li>
				<li>A sourcing agent can really cover a lot of aspects your importing projects.</li>
				<li>May be someone who finds product, but can also be more detailed in terms of auditing and inspecting factories, production management, and deliver from China to wherever you are.</li>
				<li>Some sourcing agents only offer some services, and some offer all the services from start to finish.</li>
				<li>They all really work quite differently.</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<b>Advantages of using sourcing agent vs. doing it yourself.</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Doing it yourself requires a lot of different tasks.</li>
				<li>There is a significant language barrier.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Also significant cultural differences.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Import/export expertise. Importing business is	challenging.</li>
				<li>Can be very difficult without experience in that area.</li>
				<li>Knowledge of local market and supplier.</li>
				<li>Knowing whether it’s a trading company or manufacturer based on knowledge of address.</li>
				<li>Choosing the right agent will mean the difference between success and failure of an import project.</li>
				<li>A sourcing agent knows the questions to ask; beginning importer does not, nor how to ask them.</li>
				<li>Small to medium companies can use a sourcing agent to good benefit.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<b>Do large companies (K-Mart, Wal-Mart, Target) use sourcing agents?</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Yes. They all have their own and use a sourcing agent.</li>
				<li>Even if people know how to go about importing process, there are still benefits from using someone with more expertise and knowledge.</li>
				<li>It’s like when you’re using tax agent or an accountant. You’re not trying to do everything yourself.</li>
				<li>Large and small companies benefit from using a sourcing agent.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<b>Is it an absolute necessity to speak Chinese to deal with Chinese factories?</b>
			<ul>
				<li>It would be very beneficial. It is not necessarily a must, but certainly 100% beneficial.</li>
				<li>There is more of a willingness to do business if you speak Chinese because of cultural similarities.</li>
				<li>By speaking the same language, also having knowledge of the local culture, ideology, and terms can create an instant understanding of the situation.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<b>Regarding trading companies and factories, what are some techniques to determine if you’re dealing with a direct source or a trading company?</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Agents can very easily identify these by address.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Most factories are located in remote zones.</li>
					<li>Trading companies are normally in high-rise building in the city.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>By asking directly, they will tell you what they are. But a factory may also have a trading	arm.</li>
				<li>This leads to further questions regarding how many employees do you have, what’s the relationship, etc.</li>
				<li>You can also ask for their business license.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>By reading the business license, you can see	if the name, address and person match.</li>
					<li>This is the research importing agents usually do.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			
			<b>What are the specific tasks and services of a sourcing agent that go from start to finish?</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Pay as you go system. You choose a particular scope of work and pay for that service.</li>
				<li>Research and tender. Finding the right supplier, contact the supplier, summarize the supplier who’s interested in that project, do quote comparison, analysis, and really get to see in black and white how the project will turn out.</li>
				<li>If project is promising, feasible, and what the client desired, the next step is to do the sampling process.</li>
				<li>A sourcing agent is not just a go between. You really need to have capacity to guide the client in the right way to help achieve the final goal, which is to be globally competitive and globally prepared.</li>
				<li>The second part of that is really to do the sampling stage and then to identify and find
the right supplier. Whether they are cooperative with the client or not, and whether they are delivering as expected.</li>
				<li>The sampling process includes drafting the purchase order and negotiating on the client’s behalf.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>To make sure the client’s interests are protected (i.e., price increases, terms,
conditions, terms of payment, quality control).</li>
					<li>All of this has already been negotiated in the purchase order package.</li>
				</ul>
				<li>Monitor the action and have the supplier fulfill what they have promised in the purchase order, during production and delivery management, coordinating with the shipping and freight-forwarding company.</li>
				<li>Also to clear customs and delivery of the product to the customer’s door.</li>
				<li>There is a lot of work involved that beginners do not understand.</li>
				<li>It is very extensive and very detailed work involved in the whole process.</li>
				<li>Each project is totally different, and some suppliers need constant micro-management.</li>
				<li>You cannot miss one step. If one party does not answer, later it will backfire on you.</li>
			</ul>

			<br>I have been watching your videos with great appreciation. They have helped me heaps already. I have never imported anything.</p>
			<p>A small group here in Townsville have got together and formed a company and my part is importing stainless steel water bottles from China. 
			<br>I have found a particular bottle I believe fits us perfectly.</p>
			<p>My concern is that I received three samples, and all three leaked when lying on their side.
			<br>The plain stainless steel one was the least, but still a leak. I contacted the company in China and he assured me that they were old stock and he guarantees the new ones do not leak.</p>
			<p>I found another company with the same bottles, my concern here is they assured me they do not leak and would send samples. But, they are a bit more difficult to communicate with. I know I need to go over there, however I do not know enough.</p>
