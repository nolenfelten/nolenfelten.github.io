<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>When I was in 4th grade, my school was lucky enough to have a Chess club. 
We would meet in the cafeteria after school.
Two gentlemen taught +30 kids chess, one of them had over 30 years of tournament-winning experience under his belt.
All three grade level students (4th, 5th, and 6th), adopted the sport as the schools favourite.<p>

<p>The school chess spirit was very proud. 
My high school had very little interest in their home football team.
How did these two men manage to teach proper eiquette to children?
I will always carry the integrity and honor they taught me to other areas of my life, especially business.</p>

<h2>Case Study</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>On a warm and windy night in Santa Rosa, California on October 9th, 2017. 
I actually was not in Santa Rosa that night, but I lived there and left to help a family friend who is mentally handicapped set up her new TV.
Anyway, we got the TV up and turned on the news to see that a K-Mart in downtown caught fire.</p>

<p>It fed off the air, carrying dinner plate-size embers 12 miles across Sonoma County in four hours. 
The fire consumed 36,807 acres and destroyed 5,636 houses, businesses and other structures. 
It was joined by several other blazes throughout the North Bay that killed 41 people.
The highest death toll of any wildfire disaster in the state’s history.</p>

<p>Everything I owned was lost in the fire. 
I couldn't find the nerve to go back and my Facebook news feed was filled with friends horror stories.
What was there to go back to? I lost my computer which meant I lost all my money.</p>

<p>Why put myself through that nightmare, I decided it would be best to take my life and start it somewhere else in Sacramento.
Breathe in the change, the only way is up again. 
However, I couldn't stay with my friend because her trust fund specifically stated no roommates allowed.
I am the last one alive in my family, and I was 24 in a new city filled with strangers I didn't know. </p>

<p>With no money, I slept in the streets a few nights because I didn't know how to access any resources.
One day I had came up with the idea to throw a Chess tournament after watching 2 men playing at a park.
Then I thought about using the tournament to raise money to cover the cost of getting an apartment.
I went the downtown law library and found that there was no reason why I couldnt do it.</p>

<p>First I needed to find a place to throw the event.
Looking to use a park in Sacramento, I found myself reading the <a href="https://www.cityofsacramento.org/ParksandRec/Permits/Special-Events">Youth, Parks, and Community Enrichment</a> section of the city's website.
My event classified as a "Special Event", according to my reading online.</p>
